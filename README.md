I think, that possible UI mistakes are:
1) the toolbar title is incomprehensible abbreviation or article. There should be something more informative;
2) the arrow "back button" bigger than needs
3) one divider - paler than the other;
4) the gaps between the dividers not the same size;
5) the page content have text data on Russian and Ukrainian languages at the same time;
